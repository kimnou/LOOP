###FIBONACCI SERIES: is a series in which each number is the sum of the
###preceding two numbers. By default, the first two numbers are 0 and 1.

###Make an algorithm that prints the first 100 numbers of the fibonacci series.
###(think about how you can access the current counter and previous counter value)

# a,b=0,1
# while a<100:
#     print(a, end=" ")
#     a,b=b,a+b
        
# n=int(input("enter number"))
# a,b=0,1
# i=0
# while i<n:
#     print(a)
#     i+=1
#     a,b=b,a+b

# n=int(input("enter number"))
# a,b=0,1
# i=0
# while i<n:
#     print(a)
#     next=a+b
#     a=b
#     b=next
#     i=i+1
