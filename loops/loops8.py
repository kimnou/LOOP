###numbers divisible by 3, print "nav"
###numbers divisible by 7, print "gurukul"
###numbers divisible by both 3 and 7, print "navgurukul"
###if no. is not in above case, print number only.
# n=100
# i=1
# while i<=n:
#     if i%3==0 and i%7==0:
#         print("NavGurukul")
#     if i%3==0:
#         print("nav")
#     elif i%7==0:
#         print("gurukul")
#     else:
#         print(i)
#     i+=1
